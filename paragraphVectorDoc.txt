Paragraph Vector: An unsupervised framework that learns continuous distributed vector representations for pieces of texts.
Paragraph vectors are unique among paragraphs while the word vectors are shared.

Creating document vector: 
==========================
1. Form the weighted average of all the words in a document.
	- loses the word order in the same way as the standard bag of words models do

2. using parse tree to combine word vectors using matrix-vector operations
	- works only on sentence level since it relies on parsing.

Plus side of paragraph vector:
==============================
Applicable to text of any length: sentences/ paragraphs/ documents
Does not require task-specific tuning of the word weighting function
Does not rely on parse trees
