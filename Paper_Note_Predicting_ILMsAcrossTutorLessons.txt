*** Using existing performance data to adjust parameters for each individual student improves model fit, and leads to different practice
recommendations.

Definitions:
=============
1. BKT (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing):
estimates the probability that a student knows each of the knowledge components (KC) in a tutor lession.
2. IDW (Individual Difference weights):
Three sets of best-fitting IDWs are computed from 31 KCs in lesson 1, 22 KCs in lesson 2, combined set of 53 KCs in lesson 1&2.

Study description:
=================
* Students in this study worked through two successive topics in the genetic pathway analysis curriculum within the GCT 
( Genetics Cognitive Tutor)
--- topic 1: Gene Interaction
       ---- examines how two genes can interact in different ways in controlling a single trait.
--- topic 2: Gene Regulation
       ---- 3 gene systems: 2 genes function together to control the expression of the third gene.

** five student activities for each topic:
--- 1. Reading instructional texts.
--- 2. Taking a conceptual knowledge pretest.
--- 3, 4. Complete two GCT lessons. two tutor lessons per topic.
--- 5. Complete a problem solving post test.

Data gathered from first two lessons are used to train the BKT parameters and predicting the performance in a third lesson.

 
Findings/Conclusions:
====================
-- Directly applying the best-fitting IDWs from either of two prior lessons does not appreciably improve the goodness of fit for lesson 3,
compared to the SBKT model (standard model without IDWs).

-- Directly applying the best-fitting 

-- IDWs can be successfully predicted without including pretest measures.(which is a valuable insight since pretests may not be available
online)

-- Reading time measures may reflect knowledge acquisition strategies as well as any knowledge acquired.
