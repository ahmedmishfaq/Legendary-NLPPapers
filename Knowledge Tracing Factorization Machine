Existing methods:
=================
1: temporal latent variable models
2. factor analysis with temporal features

FM (Factorization Machines) encompass several existing models as special cases:
additive factor model
performance factor model
multidimensional IRT

This FM is particularly useful for sparse data.. many students answering few of the many questions, which is a common phenomenon in MOOC settings


Key findings from the experiments:
=====================================
1. Better to estimate a bias (?) for each item. not only skills --- which popular EDMs do not.
2. Most existing models in EDM cannot handle side information such as multiple skills for one item.
3. Side information improves performance more than increasing the latent dimension.

Factor Analysis:
================
Learn common factors in data (for instance sparse matrix) in order to generalize observations (for instance matrix completion).

logit p = log(p/1-p)

Factor analysis with temporal feature to encode temporal features: 
complement the data with temporal features such as simple counters.

IRT (Item response theory)
=========================

logit p ij = theta i - d j
theta i = ability of student i (student bias)
d j = difficulty of question j (question bias)

*** Wilson have shown that DKT, with too many parameters prone to overfitting, get outperformed by IRT even without temporal feature.


**** VERY VERY IMPORTANT: IRT performs better than DKT so I can work on this!!! ******
